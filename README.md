# INS_LAB - Cryptographic Ciphers

This repository contains Java and Python implementations of various classical cryptographic ciphers. These ciphers are fundamental in understanding how encryption techniques evolved over time.

## Implemented Ciphers

- **Caesar Cipher** - A simple substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher** - A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from a fixed shuffled alphabet.
- **Playfair Cipher** - A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 matrix.
- **Hill Cipher** - A polygraphic substitution cipher based on matrix multiplication.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher** - A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that encrypts text using a repeating keyword-based shifting technique.
- **Feistel Cipher** - A symmetric encryption algorithm that splits plaintext into two halves and applies multiple rounds using XOR operations and a key. It forms the basis of modern block ciphers like DES.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can check by running:

```java -version```

If Java is not installed, download and install it from oracle.com or OpenJDK.

# Running the Programs
Each cipher program is a standalone Java class. Follow these steps to run them:

1.Clone the repository
```
