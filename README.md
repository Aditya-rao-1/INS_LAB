# 🔐 INS_LAB - Cryptographic Ciphers

Welcome to **INS_LAB**, a comprehensive collection of classical cryptographic ciphers implemented in **Java** and **Python**. This repository serves as a gateway to understanding the evolution of encryption techniques, laying the foundation for modern cryptography.

## 🚀 Implemented Ciphers
Dive into the world of cryptography with the following cipher implementations:

### 1. Caesar Cipher
🔑 A beginner-friendly **substitution cipher** that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions.
- Simple yet effective
- Easy to crack with frequency analysis

### 2. Monoalphabetic Cipher
🔄 A **substitution cipher** where each letter is replaced by a unique corresponding letter from a shuffled alphabet.
- Stronger than Caesar Cipher
- Vulnerable to frequency analysis

### 3. Playfair Cipher
🎲 A **digraph substitution cipher** encrypting pairs of letters using a 5x5 matrix.
- Eliminates repeated letters
- More secure than simple substitution ciphers

### 4. Hill Cipher
📊 A **polygraphic cipher** that uses matrix multiplication to encrypt plaintext blocks.
- Uses linear algebra concepts
- Offers better security than single-letter ciphers

### 5. Vigenère Cipher
🔑✨ A **polyalphabetic cipher** employing a keyword-based shifting technique.
- Resists frequency analysis
- One of the most famous classical ciphers

### 6. Feistel Cipher
🔐 A **symmetric encryption algorithm** splitting plaintext into two halves and applying multiple rounds of encryption.
- Forms the basis of modern block ciphers like **DES**
- Provides high security with multiple rounds
